// Dinner Guests: Working with one of the programs from Exercises 14 through 18, print a message indicating the number of people you are inviting to dinner.
// Define an array of guest names
var guestList = ["Rehan", "asad", "Bilal", "Ali"];
// Print the number of people being invited to dinner
console.log("Number of people being invited to dinner:", guestList.length);
// Iterate through each guest in the array and print an invitation message
for (var i = 0; i < guestList.length; i++) {
    console.log("Hi " + guestList[i] + ", I would like to invite you to dinner.");
}
